HW 3 due tonight

    Reminder: correct submission format

    repo/tree/digital fingerprint

    starting on HW 3, there will be a 5 pt deduction for
    submissions in the wrong format

    no new homework this week


Exam 1 is Thursday, February 8
    will review today

////////////////////////////////

Today:

- Reminder: order of operations
- Deduction rules with implies operator
- Exam 1 review

////////////////////////////////

Order of operations reminder.


p ∨ q ∧ r is equivalent to... ?

q, r ⊢ p ∨ q ∧ r
{
    1. q            premise
    2. r            premise
    3. q ∧ r        ^i 1 2
    4. p ∨ q ∧ r    Vi2 3
    //what now?
}

///////////////////////////////

Implies-elimination, →e

      P, P → Q
→e: -----------
        Q


Example:

//Suppose we know x > 5. What can we conclude?

if (x > 5) {
    y = 17;
}

///////////////////////////////

Syntax for using →e:

a. P                (some justification)
b. P → Q            (some justification)
c. Q                →e b a


////////////////////////////////////////

Example (implies1.logika):

(p ∧ q) → r,  p → q,  p  ⊢ r



Example (implies2.logika):

p → r,  q → r,  p ∨ q  ⊢ r


////////////////////////////////////////

Implies-introduction, →i

      {P assume
      ... Q}
→i: -----------
      P → Q


Idea: if Q is true whenever P is, then we can promise that
    if P is true, then Q is too.

This is the relationship P → Q.




////////////////////////////////////////

Syntax for using →i:

a. {
    b. P            assume
    ...
    c. Q            (some justification)
}
d. P → Q            →i a

Exam 1 review.

Covers everything we've done up to this point:

- Basic logical reasoning (over English statements and if-statements)
- Logic puzzles
- Circuits
- Truth tables
- Parse trees
- Proving two propositional logic statements are equivalent
    how?
        truth tables
            fill out two truth tables
            show that for each truth assignment, both statements
                have same output
        natural deduction
            do two proofs
            one as premise, one as conclusion
            then switch

- Proving propositional logic statements are NOT equivalent
    how?

    need one counterexample (a truth assignment) where
    the two statements have different output


- DeMorgan's laws on propositional logic (and their application)
    (like the HW)

    NOT(p AND q)      NOT p OR NOT q
    NOT (p OR q)      NOT p AND NOT q

- Satisfiability: whether there is at least one truth assignment
    that makes the statement true

    how prove satisfiable?
        need ONE truth assignment that makes it true
        (or show truth table is tautology or contingent)

    how prove not satisfiable?
        need a full truth table, show contradictory


- Translating between English and propositional logic

- Arguments (premises and a proposed conclusion)



- Determining whether an argument is valid or invalid
    how prove valid? need truth tables (see below)

    how prove invalid?
        need one counterexample. find one truth assignment
        where all premises are true but the conclusion is false


- Proving an argument with truth tables
    idea? need a truth table for every premise and the conclusion
    show that every truth assignment that makes all the premises
    true also makes the conclusion true

    if I can do this, is a valid argument



- Natural deduction proofs in propositional logic using the
    AND, OR, and IMPLIES rules


Closed notes/computers.

All problems will be "open-ended" - similar in content/format
to HW problems.

Some problems will ask for a proof or explanation -- read carefully!
